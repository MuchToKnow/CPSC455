Project Description:

○ Who is it for?
    
    ○ Individuals who want to buy or sell parking spot spaces in a peer to peer environment. Anyone looking to purchase
    parking spots for a cheaper price, or rent their private parking spots for a passive side income.

○ What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
    
    ○ The app will facilitate listing of parking spots to rent
    ○ The app will facilitate renting of parking spots
    ○ The app will maintain user accounts to track which parking spots they have rented, prices, availability, etc.

○ What type of data will it store?
    
    ○ User profile information. (Name, Address, Location)
    ○ pictures
    ○ Parking spots and its coordinates / address
    ○ Information and instructions to access the parking lots

○ What will users be able to do with this data?
    
    ○ Users can edit their own user data as well as edit their parking spot listing attributed (address, pictures, description, etc.)

○ What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
    
    ○ Facilitating the listing and renting of storage spaces
    ○ Ability to facilitate listing and renting of commercial parking spaces

Project task requirements:

○ 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
    
    ○ User account creation
    ○ User login and logout
    ○ Parking spot listing creation
    ○ Parking spot rental purchases
    ○ Browsing page for listings (like Airbnb)

○ 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)
    
    ○ User profile page
    ○ User profile editing
    ○ Customer support page
    ○ Integration with a map API
    ○ Address and neighbourhood based search for parking spots

    ○ Identity and ownership authentication API (Persona)
    ○ Integration with credit / debit card API
    ○ Referral program for friends/family to join as lister/renter
    ○ Subscription program to park at any listings

Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller
tasks!
    
    ○ User account creation
        ○ Create mongo db on GCP (look into mongodb atlas?)
        ○ Collect name, email, password, phone number
        ○ Simple web form that creates a user in the db
    ○ User login and logout
        ○ login authentication done with firebase
        ○ Simple login form that allows users to authenticate with our website
        ○ When logged in, logout button is visible to allow users to logout

Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these
physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.
